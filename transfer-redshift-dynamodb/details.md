COPY command is designed to copy data from DynamoDB table to a Redshift table, however, the vice-versa is currently not possible using this command.

As a work-around, the below mentioned methods can be followed:

1. <b>exporting/importing as CSV:</b>
The idea behind this approach is to export the data from Redshift as a CSV file and then, using "Imports from S3" feature in DynamoDB to load into table. Steps involved:

    a. Go to the "Redshift Query editor V2" and export the table data as CSV file using "Export" button.

    b. Store the exported CSV file into an S3 bucket.

    c. Next, go to "Imports from S3" feature in DynamoDB console to import data stored in S3 in step (b.) into a new DynamoDB table.

2. <b>using Unload command:</b>
This approach will use "UNLOAD" command to copy data from Redshift table to S3 bucket in CSV format. After that, "Imports from S3" feature in DynamoDB can be used to load into table. Please execute the command mentioned in "<b><i>unload.txt</i></b>" file in "Redshift Query editor V2".

<b>Please note that above two methods will always create a new table and then, insert the data into it.</b>

3. <b>using Glue:</b>

The idea behind this approach is to use Glue connector and Spark job to read table data from Redshift and write it to DynamoDB table. Steps involved:

    a. Create a VPC end-point of type "Gateway" for S3 and DynamoDB service, for the VPC of Redshift workgroup.
    
    b. Create a JDBC connector using "Data Connections" in Glue console. Please mention the Redshift workgroup JDBC URL, username and password. In the "Network Options", mention the VPC, subnet and security group of the workgroup.
    
    c. Create a "Spark Script Editor" job in AWS Glue console and add the connector created in step (b.) under "Job Details" ---> "Advanced Properties".
    
    d. Replace the code with "pyspark.py" script in the job.

    e. Save and Run the job for copying data from Redshift table to DynamoDB table.

<b>Please note that this method assumes the DynamoDB table already exists in your account in the specific region and the schema (partition key and sort key) is similar to Redshift table.</b>
